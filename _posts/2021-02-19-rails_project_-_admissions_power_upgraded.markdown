What started out as a simple CLI project, has now blossomed into a full scale rails application which, for all intents and purposes works great. Admissions power is a web application that allows students the ability to search for programs that they wish to apply to. The student can then learn about those programs, apply to and track their status. Admissions administrators can list new programs as well as process applications submitted to their respective programs. 

This project forced me to learn more about rails conventions and how when followed, leads a user to making an app that is both user and developer friendly. While making this app, I challenged myself to be as dry as possible in my code, a tasked that proved to be harder than I thought it would be, but in the end, one that strengthened my understanding of software development.
