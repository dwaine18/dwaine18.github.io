Coding my Sinatra project was an intense learning experience. It was exciting to see all the aspects of building the backend  that I had learned throughout the various labs, finally coming together to build an actual working application. My Sinatra project, which is part two in a three-part series, picked up right where my CLI application had left off. My goal is to show how the complexity of my applications increases as I grow on my journey to becoming a software engineer. 

Admissions Power is an "All In One" application and admissions portal where students seeking admissions to a program can sign up, log on, submit an application and eventually view the result of that application. The idea for this application came directly from my most immediate work experience as an admissions counselor. Feel free to view a walkthrough of the working application here: https://youtu.be/kgVwHehp7v0. My rails project will conclude the series where I will launch the application on a web platform for all to use and explore. 

While I was comfortable with several aspects of coding in ruby, namely working with the Model View Controller build out, this project tested my understanding of SQL. While Active Record was amazing, I did, at times, find myself stumped as to why  information that I had expected to be shown was not showing. I relied heavily on "binding.pry," and after hours of playing around with my code, I eventually came out with a much stronger grasp of Active Record and the underlying SQL queries that were being performed. 

The most difficult aspect of this project for me was linking a student record with an application record without the student having to explicitly enter their student ID number in the application as I had them do in the CLI application. 

Overall this project really opened my eyes to the amazing wonders of Ruby and Active Record and I am excited to build a fully functioning amazing app in rails. Stay tuned!
